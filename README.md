# üõ°Ô∏è RiskScope: AI-Powered IP Threat Intelligence Platform

**RiskScope** is a streamlined, AI-assisted threat intelligence tool designed for SOC analysts, threat hunters, and cybersecurity professionals. It aggregates **IP address** reputation data from multiple open-source threat intel APIs (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Whois, etc.) and generates actionable, concise risk summaries using a locally running LLaMA 3 model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Built with **Streamlit**, the tool offers an intuitive web interface for quick, multi-IP analysis.

##  Features

-  Bulk **IP reputation lookup** across trusted platforms:
    - [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com/)
    - [AbuseIPDB](https://abuseipdb.com/)
    - [Whois (ARIN RDAP)](https://rdap.arin.net/)
-  **AI Risk Summary**: Local LLM (LLaMA 3.2 via Ollama) evaluates and summarizes the threat context and assigns a risk level (Low, Medium, High).
-  **Cross-validation**: Detects conflicts like "clean on VirusTotal but flagged on AbuseIPDB".
-  Insight into **"clean" IPs** that may be abused for malicious purposes (e.g., residential proxies).
-  **Streamlit-based GUI** ‚Äî no terminal needed.

##  Streamlit Web UI

The UI is built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), offering:

- A textarea for entering **comma-separated IPs**
- Side-by-side view of:
    - VirusTotal results
    - AbuseIPDB reports
    - Whois info
- AI-generated risk summary with classification

Launch it using:

```bash
streamlit run RiskScope.py
```

Or for Noob failed python installations(like myself):

```jsx
python3 -m streamlit run RiskScope.py
```
